Skip
-------

*Working Draft - September 2017*

This is a Draft RFC Specification for Skip, a reactive programming language created by Facebook. The development of this standard started in 2016. Skip is a new and evolving language and is not complete. Significant enhancement will continue in future editions of this specification.

**Whatâ€™s New/Different in this Edition**

1. Clarified that traits are *not* interfaces, but are copied into using classes. Generally tightened up wording w.r.t traits.
1. Removed the former "class/trait-named-dot" replacing it with the general dot-prefix notation to lift a top-level name declared in a named module, to the unnamed global module.
1. Beefed up the description of algenraic functions.
1. Added support for constant patterns, and allowed a leading minus on numeric literal patterns.
1. Cleaned up a bunch of odds and ends.
